  Missing test scenarios:

  1. Dependency ordering verification - Current tests don't verify that dependencies actually run before their dependents. This is core
   functionality.
  2. Worker halting on error - When a worker fails, pending workers should be halted (status changes to :halted). This critical
  error-handling behavior isn't tested.
  3. State transitions and status management - Tests don't verify worker status transitions: pending -> running ->
  finished/error/halted.
  4. Results passing to dependent workers - No verification that results from completed workers are passed to their dependents via the
  {:run_requested, results} cast.
  5. Complex dependency chains with mixed success/failure - Current tests are either all-success or single-failure. Missing scenarios
  like "A succeeds, B fails, C depends on A and should still run, D depends on B and should be halted".
  6. Integration testing of orchestration logic - Current tests are high-level end-to-end. Missing focused tests on how Server
  coordinates with WhichInsertersCanRun, InserterWorkersStatus, and DependencyResolver.
